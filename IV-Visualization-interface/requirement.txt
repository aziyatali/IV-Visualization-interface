Here are the requirements how to run my application.

1. First, please download Node.js based on your Operating System from here.
https://nodejs.org/en/download/

2. After downloading Node.js then download http-server with npm.(since Chrome doesn't allow to get data from local files)

             npm install --global http-server

or it can be found here
https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server

3. Please go into the src folder where data.js file exists, then on terminal write this code:

             http-server

Then it should open the localhost(if not please check the localhost based on it's port(e.g.3000)
